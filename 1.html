  <p>In a previous figure, we found Cdon mutation and ethanol make synergy in HPEC. In a figure 4 and 5, we will see the <strong>repression of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" title="SHH wikipedia">Sonic hedgehog signaling</a></u></strong>, which has correlation with HPEC, to support HPEC arose because of synergy of two factors. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:45px">SHH signaling molecules have key roles in the development of central nerve system of vertebrate. And the SHH which is produced by prechordal mesendoderm(PCM), is one of the important protein to form midline of forebrain. SHH activates Ptch receptor as ligand, and Ptch activate trascription factor Gli. </p>
